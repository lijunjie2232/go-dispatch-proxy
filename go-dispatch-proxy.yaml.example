# Sample configuration file for go-dispatch-proxy
# This file demonstrates the YAML format for configuring the load balancer

# Listen host and port for the SOCKS proxy server
listen_host: "127.0.0.1"
listen_port: 8080

# Enable tunnel mode (acts as a transparent load balancing proxy)
tunnel_mode: false

# Disable logs
quiet_mode: false

# Use network devices to dispatch connections
use_devices: false

# List of load balancers
load_balancers:
  # Format 1: Using device@IP format (traditional way)
  # - address: "eth0@192.168.1.100"
  #   cont_ratio: 2
    
  # Format 2: Using separate device field (new approach)
  - device: "eth0"
    cont_ratio: 1

  # Format 3: Just IP address (when not using devices)
  # - address: "192.168.1.102"
  #   cont_ratio: 1

  # Example for tunnel mode (SOCKS5 proxies):
  # - address: "127.0.0.1:1080"
  #   cont_ratio: 1
  #
  # - address: "127.0.0.1:1081"
  #   cont_ratio: 1
